<b>Setting up the MyoType</b>

To ultilize this tool, go to https://developer.thalmic.com/downloads and download their sdk and firmware for you desired device. 

Then navigate to https://developer.thalmic.com/docs/api_reference/platform/getting-started.html to get the sdk and your myo set up. 

Run the code and have fun using your arm as a keyboard.


<b>Using the MyoKeyboard</b>

The MyoType has 7 distinct controls.

A left movement shifts left on the morse code binary tree.

A right movement shift right on the morse code binary tree. 

An upward movement acts as a backspace button.

A single downward movement chooses the current character as the written character.

A double downward movement creates a space and starts a new word.

A twist of the arm increases and decreases the speed of typing depending on the it is a clockward or counter-clockward twist respectively.
